## Why do I have this website?

> To serve as a redirection page to my [actual portfolio](https://ajitpanigrahi.com). Some people kept checking `ajitzero.github.io` after coming from one of my repo websites, and encountered 404s. Might as well point them in the [right way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

If you came here looking for my previous website then you can go visit https://github.dev for the original source, which is also likely the most recent version available
