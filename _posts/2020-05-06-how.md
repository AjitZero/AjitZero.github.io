title: "But How?"

# You can make this website too!

This website is cloned (you can also fork it) from [github.dev](https://github.dev) from their repo, [github/personal-website](https://github.com/github/personal-website), which makes it super easy to modify and deploy!

It's built upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with [Markdown](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/) files for posts and [YAML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/) for config (as always).

I cloned it since I decided to make a few modifications here and there to customise it to my liking, but most of it is untouched. You can also [fork my version](https://github.com/AjitZero/ajitzero.github.io/fork) of the repo if you like!
